This is a project under the Statistics and Mathematics society at IIT Kanpur - Stamatics, IITK - aimed at learning important concepts of Game Theory and Auctions. <br/>
Topics such as Strategic Games, Nash Equilibrium, Multi-Strategy Nash Equilibrium, First-price and Second-price auctions, Revenue equivalence Theorem, etc. were covered. <br/>
I referred to the books *An Introduction to Game Theory* by Martin J. Osborne and *Game Theory and Mechanism Design* by Y. Narhari. <br/> <br/>
My gratitude to the mentor - Mr. Panshul Mehta (BS-Economics, IITK'23) - for their help and guidance throughout the project.
